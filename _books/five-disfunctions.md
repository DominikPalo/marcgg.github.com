This book is about running and being part of an effective executive team and reads like a novel. You follow an organisation with problems and how its members are going to fix it. I personally loved it and would recommend to anyone part of a leadership team. Reading about concepts such as absence of trust or fear of conflict is made way more engaging by taking this approach focused on a group of characters, and on top of that the situations showcased are realistic and there are a lot of actionnable points.
