The subtitle sums up the book quite well: "Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity". This management book is all about sharing what people need to hear in order to progress, but doing it with care. The autor tries to showcase the middleground between total conflict avoidance and being a blunt jerk that "tells it like it is". The whole approach is about caring personally about the other person and taking actions to help other grow. Even if sometimes the author repeats a point a bit too much, it's still a good book that can be very helpful for those having to lead teams.
