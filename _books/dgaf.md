A lot of people will hate the very direct style of this book, but if you can get past it there is some substance to it. The autor explains that it's important to stop being positive all the time in order to improve and live a better life. Accepting one's situation or looking at things in a different light can go a long way. Overall I liked the message and examples given, and while I didn't love the writting style, I was ok with it. It's a decent book, but a bit too long for the message it's trying to convey.
