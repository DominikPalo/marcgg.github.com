Subtitled "How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action", the book explains that companies have to sell a vision and a mission to customers, employees and investors. The initial idea and explanation is honnestly great, and the author drives it home by repeating over and over again that people don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it. However while there are some good points and interesting examples in this book, it felt like it could be half as long and convey the same message. A lot of sections are drawn out ad nauseam, and after the umpteenth to Apple I just wanted to stop reading.
