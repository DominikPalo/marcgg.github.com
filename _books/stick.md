This is a great followup book for anyone who read the Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell. In this book, the author elaborates on the idea of "stickiness" and gives concrete examples of what can make an idea stay in the mind of people. There are a lot of case studies, and while most of it feels like common sense it's very well articulated and explained.
