A great dive into how important design is to our everyday lives, and what designer need to do to make sure they provide the best experience to end users. Some parts are a bit drawn out, repeating the same basic ideas, but overall the book remains pleasant to read and has some learnings - even not always directly applicable. One thing that I wasn't a big fan of, was the fact that the author always building the engineers and designers against each others, with the engineers never really understanding the need for design - which is not the best basis for constructive discussion.
